Ramen Rater
Ramen Rater is a simple web application that allows users to browse, rate, and review different types of ramen from various restaurants. The app uses a local JSON server to fetch ramen data and dynamically updates the DOM to display ramen images, details, and reviews. Users can also add new ramen to the list and delete existing ramen entries.

Features
Display Ramen List: A menu with images of various ramen dishes fetched from a local API.
View Details: Clicking on a ramen image displays more details, such as the ramen's name, restaurant, rating, and user comments.
Add New Ramen: Users can submit a form to add a new ramen dish to the list.
Delete Ramen: Each ramen entry has a delete button that allows users to remove it from the menu.

Usage
Browse Ramen: The ramen menu displays images of ramen dishes. Click on an image to view its details, rating, and comments.
Add New Ramen: Fill in the form at the bottom of the page to add a new ramen dish to the list. This will update the ramen menu with the newly added dish.
Delete Ramen: Click the delete button next to a ramen dish to remove it from the list.
